# Keras YOLO Series
Keras implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) : Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

This is a [Keras](https://keras.io/)
implementation of YOLO, and YOLOv2.
This project is mainly based on [darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow)
and [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).

For details about YOLO and YOLOv2 please refer to their [project page](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 
and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242):
YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.
